## Summary
This book shows the moments we are way too much influenced and tips to how to overcome it.

## Influential Tools
**1. Click, zum:** They are the ones fixed inside our habits. They're basically a start action that trigger a common response.

Ex:
- Someone is going to print something
- You ask: "Can I print my document because I need to print it?" **(Click)**
- You receive a response: "Yes" **(zum)**.

So, we can say it is a response (not minded) given by an input.

**2. Shortcuts:** When we give a easy/fast response to something based on a not minded thought. We usually do it because our modern life goes so fast that we can not take 100% minded decisions everytime (because we lack of time).

Ex:
- Your leader said you need to do 'A' and you feel like he meant 'B', but you don't try to say it to him because he's the leader.
- You buy something expensive because you assume that it is expensive because it is good.
