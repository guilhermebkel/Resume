## Summary
This book shows the moments we are way too much influenced and tips to how to overcome it.

## Influential Tools
**1. Click, zum:** They are the ones fixed inside our habits. They're basically a start action that trigger a common response.

Ex:
- Someone is going to print something
- You ask: "Can I print my document because I need to print it?" **(Click)**
- You receive a response: "Yes" **(zum)**.

So, we can say it is a response (not minded) given by an input.

**2. Shortcuts:** When we give a easy/fast response to something based on a not minded thought. We usually do it because our modern life goes so fast that we can not take 100% minded decisions everytime (because we lack of time).

Ex:
- Your leader said you need to do 'A' and you feel like he meant 'B', but you don't try to say it to him because he's the leader.
- You buy something expensive because you assume that it is expensive because it is good.

## Reciprocity
Usually we can be driven by the reciprocity influence, since our society usually tag not reciprocal people as bad ones.

**1. Reciprocal concession:** When someone tries to give us something and we refuse it, if this person asks for something after, we're commonly driven to give something back since we refused the initial concession.

Ex:
- A little guy asks you to buy a cine ticket for $5 dollar bills and you refuse it.
- So he says "Well, if you're not going to buy this ticket, what about some chocolate? It will costs you $1".
- Then you buy the chocolate.
