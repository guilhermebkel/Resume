## Summary
This book explains the existence of two kinda mindsets: **Fixed** and **Growth**.

## Basic difference between mindsets
- Fixed
	- Which in contact with a challenge, gets stuck and just gives up on it.
	-	Afraid to make mistakes.
	- Feels good to take challenges that prove current knowledge.

- Growth
	-	Which in touch with a challenge, try everything possible to nail it.
	-	Not afraid to make mistakes and hungry for hard challenges.
	- "In the growth mindset, people does not only look for a challenge, but improve themselves with it. Bigger the challenge, bigger the improvement".

## How to know which mindset I am enrolled at today?

One of the ways to know to which of these mindsets you belong today, just ask yourself: ```"When do you feel your intelligent? When you're perfect or when your learning?"```
