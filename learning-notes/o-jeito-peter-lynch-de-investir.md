## Summary

This book was written by one of the most successful investors ever. He gives some tips that were really useful for him to make good investment decisions during the years.

## About stock price going down fear

Usually when people start investing, buying some stock options and after some days see their prices going down, starts to sell it and look for another stock options.

Lynch tell us that you don't have to worry about the prices going down (since you know why you have bought it), because if you buy 10 stock options and at least 6 of them get to the expected price, you'll probably make lots of profit.

## About buying new stock options

You just have to invest in stock options that you could handle to loose and this lost couldn't make any bad effect on your day-to-day life soon.

## About selling stock options

It is important to keep the stock with yourself while the company fundamentals (the ones that have driven your decision to buy it) have not change since you've bought it.

## About the market road

Lynch tells us about how the market works during the periods of high and low prices, comparing it to a cocktail party:

1. In the first stage, in the start of a ascendent market (a market which was in a down moment for some time and no one thinks it will get up again) the people does not event talk about stock options and if there's a investor on the party talking about what he does, people will get away from him.

2. In the second stage, some time has gone, the market improved 15%, people don't talk about stock options with anyone, neither with the investor already.

3. In the third stage, some time has gone again, the market improved 30%, people start talking about stock options with the investor, even looking for recommendations of what is good to be bought that time (at least one of the ones who are talking about it has invested on some stock option).

4. In the fourth stage, the people keep talking about stock options, but this time, instead of asking for recommendation, they are giving tips about what to buy and, if you feel like you worry about not have bought the stock the recommended stock options by them, it is a clear signal that the market is about to fall down.

## Useful tips

- Take advantage of what you already know
- Look for opportunities that weren't discovered already by the market
- Invest in companies, not in stock options
- Ignore the market price variation in the short term
- It is useless to predict the economy
- It is useless to predict the market short term
- The long term results are even more predictable and profitable than the ones of government bonds investment
