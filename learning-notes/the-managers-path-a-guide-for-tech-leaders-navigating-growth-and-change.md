## Summary
This book gives some tips about how to become a Tech Leader.

## What to expect from a Manager
- **One-on-one meetings:** Good to improve relations, to give feedbacks about projects as well as solving doughts.
- **Feedback and Workplace Guidance:** Getting behavioral and technical feedbacks, helps improving people as soon as they've made something that is not so good or vice-versa (usually the bad ones must be given privately and the good ones publicly since it shows to other people what's usually a good act).
- **Training and Career Growth:** Receiving tips about courses, classes, books and every other thing that helps people improving themselves in order to grow in the career they want to.

## How to be Managed
- **Spend time thinking about what you want:** It's important to know what you're looking for your career since that's the only way the manager can helping you achieving it.
- **You are responsible for yourself:** Seek as many feedbacks as you can, if you're unhappy, say something, when you're stuck, ask for help, when you want a raise, ask for it, when you want a promotion, find out what you need to do in order to get it.
- **Give you're manager a break:** Always you're able to, bring solutions to your manager, not problems.
- **Choose your managers wisely:** Your manager can make a huge difference in your life, he can get you promoted, attention or feedback from important people and job opportunities after you stop working for them.

## Mentoring an Intern
- **Listen carefully:** That's the first and most basic skill of managing people. Pay attention to what others are saying, don't keep thinking about what you're going to say next neither about your own work. So, be prepared to say anything complex in different ways, just end the conversation if you really understood what the other said.
- **Clearly communicate:** If you're expecting something to happen by other people, talk about it.
- **Calibrate your response:** Lot of things can happen during the mentoring, so, in order to get a good project done by the intern, try to get in touch with him (once a week, etc) to give the right adjustments on what is going to be done.
- **Basic TO-DOs when you're going to mentoring an intern**: Prepare his arrival (prepare the place, tools, etc); Have a project for him to work on (have a clear project to get him to work on); Plan to have him present the work he did at the end of the program (optional).

## Tips to be a great Tech Lead
- **Understand the architecture:** If you were given to lead a project that you don't understand the architecture, give it a time to get it. Try to understand how to data flows on it, how it affects the final product and what is the core logic.
- **Be a Team Player:** If you're doing all the interesting stuff, try to find boring ones since it will help you understand the project problems and gaps. By doing that, you'll allow to other programmers to stretch themselves to big improvements (since they will be doing some harder stuffs).
- **Lead technical decisions:** You'll be involved in a lot of technical decisions, but it doesn't mean you have to decide everything. Try to understand what decisions need to be done by you and others that need to be done by the team and people with more expertise.
- **Communicate:** Give the team members a moment to talk and try to represent your team on the meetings. Now your productivity is less important than the productivity of the whole team.

## Good manager, Bad Manager
- **The alpha geek:** The person with high technical level, able to solve the most hard problems, able to inspire juniors but, accepts only his solution as the better and unique to be applied, most part of the time not letting other programmers being able to solve problems.
- **The process czar:** Tries to implement a process meant to be the unique able to solve all problems. Blame all the problems on the fact of people doesn't follow the process (only he does it most part of the time). "The process is that way, and we can not change it, since that's the unique way to help solving all project problems".
- **Micromanager, delegator:** Try to get in touch with every single decision made to the project (what makes the team to not feel trusted) and if it doesn't follow what he expected, he takes on the project for himself and try to do everything the "right" way in order to deliver the project to production on time.
