**Guilherme Mota** is a problem solver way too much curious/passionate about programming, software architecture, complex systems and technologies in general.

> "As a problem solver, I know there are lots of ways to solve a problem and I feel like my mission is to always use the one which better fits to the moment, being minded about the following requirements: scalability, readability, maintainability, user usability and business logic integrity."
