# Mistakes

- **Error:** Had to refactor landing page but i did it on files 3 months old and when i replaced it, i lost all production files.
- **Solution:** Took his page cache from the last day using a google tool and copied all production html from this day to backup.

---

- **Error:** Added a hard to load database query (worked on dev but not in prod on a core system function, what leaded to get the platform down.
- **Solution:** Optimized the way we save the data, created methods to consolidate that data instead of doing it dynamically while being minded about differences between dev and prod environments.

---

- **Error:** Needed to be a mentor to an intern but micromanaged him a lot.
- **Solution:** Started giving more space and realiability for the stakeholder, trying to show the way I'd usually do some task as a way and not the only correct way.

---

- **Error:** After micromanaging an intern, I've tried to give more freedom to others, but I gave so much
- **Solution:** Now I'm minded that there are moments that you don't need to give so much freedom, so the best way to know it is by asking yourself:
...This dev has enough experience on our system to make it without workarounds, following patterns, etc?
...Is this part, a core one that needs to stay organized, good pattern followed, etc?

- **Error:** After getting into a lead position, I kept doing work thinking only on myself (it was expected since I worked alone for a long time on the organization)
- **Solution:** Now at a lead position, I try to to impact positively all the team (in a scalable way, per example)
