# Mistakes

- **Error:** Had to refactor landing page but i did it on files 3 months old and when i replaced it, i lost all production files.
- **Solution:** Took his page cache from the last day using a google tool and copied all production html from this day to backup.

---

- **Error:** Added a hard to load database query (worked on dev but not in prod on a core system function, what leaded to get the platform down.
- **Solution:** Optimized the way we save the data, created methods to consolidate that data instead of doing it dynamically while being minded about differences between dev and prod environments.

---

- **Error:** Needed to be a mentor to an intern but micromanaged him a lot.
- **Solution:** Started giving more space and reliability for the stakeholder, trying to show the way I'd usually do some task as a way and not the only correct way.

---

- **Error:** After micromanaging an intern, I've tried to give more freedom to others, but I gave so much
- **Solution:** Now I'm minded that there are moments that you don't need to give so much freedom, so the best way to know it is by asking yourself:
...This dev has enough experience on our system to make it without workarounds, following patterns, etc?
...Is this part, a core one that needs to stay organized, good pattern followed, etc?

- **Error:** After getting into a lead position, I kept doing work thinking only on myself (it was expected since I worked alone for a long time on the organization)
- **Solution:** Now at a lead position, I try to to impact positively all the team (in a scalable way, per example)

---

- **Error:** After getting into a lead position, I had to delegate a task but I did a hard one and had to get part of it to get it solved.
- **Solution:** Now I'm aware that I need to know more about the people I want to delegate and more about the task as well (if it is hard or not to be solved by the person I want to delegate to), on top of that, even if I delegate something harder, I need to give resources/opinions to help getting the problem solved without taking full part of it.

---

- **Error:** Almost gave source code access for a person outside the organization just in order to test some integration.
- **Solution:** In case other organizations need to make integration tests with our platform, we only need to create a QA Environment to help them testing the integration, without getting in touch with source code.

---

- **Error:** I didn't walk the talk when I gave support to a dev to create a feature (usually I add a feature with a feature flag and after some production tests I deploy it to all customers), so the feature was deployed with an error on a core part of the system.
- **Solution:** It is important to recommend the good things we do, since it can help a lot of people around us.
