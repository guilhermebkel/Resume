## Gitorm
Gitorm is a library I've made in order to provide a fast/easy to use interface to make common CRUD actions on a github repository you own.

This idea first started because I wanted to make an upload system to my portfolio, in order to save some mockups on cloud but I wasn't able to use paid services as AWS, Google Cloud or Azure.

This library is made in ``Typescript``, available on [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitorm) and on [**github**](https://github.com/gbkel/gitorm).

## Shugart
Shugart is a library I've made in order to provide a fast and keyed database as it's already done by Redis.

This idea first started because I wanted to make a caching system but I wasn't able to use paid services as AWS ElastiCache.

This library is made in ``Typescript``, available on [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shugart) and on [**github**](https://github.com/gbkel/shugart).

## Guardog
Guardog is a online website that provides a auto ping system for heroku free apps.

This idea first started because I usually put lots of projects on heroku because of its free tier, but It sleeps every 30 minutes, what is really bad for job application apps and even for personal projects that you want to get online 24/7.

This project is made in ``Typescript``, available on [**website**](https://github.com/guilhermebkel/guardog) and on [**github**](https://guardog.herokuapp.com/)
