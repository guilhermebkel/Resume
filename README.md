# LIFE LONG ROAD

Hello, my name is Guilherme Bromonschenkel.

My road first started when I was 14 years old and my cousin invited me to join a programming course he'd already done. That was my first contact with development (in C language) and I loved every part of it from having issues with forgetting to put some semicolons in the end of line to the making of a 2048 Game in order to finish the course.

After that course, for some random life reasons I have not kept in touch with development for almost 4 years, till I got approved on a Bachelor's Degree Electrical Engineering with minor on Computer Science and randomly decided to start programming again.

Then, I tried making data science, machine learning and a bunch of other courses with that feeling of no belonging to it.

But, everything changed when I started studying web development and making projects that I could see on live. After that 'match', I've got totally in love with web development and all the complex systems and technologies that revolves around it.

So, after almost 4 years of no programming, I've got back in the road of development and now I can tell I'm a software developer focused mainly on web development, but heavily passionate about programming, software architecture, complex systems and technology in general.

That's the repository I use to track the road I'm taking everyday in order to become a better developer, from my professional and volunteering experiences to my education, projects and skills gained through my life of software developer.
