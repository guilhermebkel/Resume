# LIFE LONG ROAD

My name is Guilherme Bromonschenkel, I'm a software developer focused mainly on web development, but heavily passionate about programming, software architecture and technology in general.

That's the repository I use to track the road I'm taking everyday in order to become a better developer, from my professional and volunteering experiences to my education, projects and skills gained through my life of software developer.
