That's a startup which has solutions for the photographer job flow, since the moment he finishes taking pictures till he delivers it to his clients. 

It is my first professional experience as a developer. Since the first day I started working there, I felt in love for real with solving problems using programming, because I discovered the pleasure of being able to impact lots of people while doing something I loved.

Even as a simple Intern, I was able to help them while learning from aws cloud architecture to software development in general, so I got in touch a lot with `AWS EC2, AWS S3, AWS SQS, AWS ElastiCache, AWS Lambda, AWS RDS, AWS CloudFront, Redis, React, Redux, NodeJS, Styled Components, Serverless and MVC Architecture`.

Besides, I had great realizations there, like, `Refactored its landing page, created a distributed information system based on Redis, solved a bug that was making them lose clients everyday, found and helped solving an architecture bug that kept all the platform offline for almost 4 entire days, created the event oriented microservices system and headed a project to refactor all the platform back-end/front-end while keeping in touch with senior developers`.

**[ 2019/02 - Current ]** [IBESVA](https://ibesva.netlify.com) ``(Web Front-end Developer)``

That's a Non-governmental organization that helps the education cause.

It was my first volunteering experience as a software developer. For the first time I was able to help people solving problems with programming, what made me fell in love with technology a little more and helped me getting into the professional road of Software Development. As a volunteer, I refactored the IBESVA's Website Design using/improving all knowledge I had when it was about `HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and Adobe XD`.
