**[ 2019/12 - Current ]** [PICSIZE](https://picsize.com.br) ``(Web Full-stack Developer)``

In december of 2019, after completing almost 6 months of internship, I've got invited to get a new software developer position.

At this new position, I helped them and learned about `Sofware Project Management`.

On top of that, it is important to know that I've `created a queue system for picture uploads on front-end with retry and fallback delay features`.

**[ 2019/06 - 2019/12 ]** [PICSIZE](https://picsize.com.br) ``(Web Full-stack Intern)``

That's a startup which has solutions for the photographer job flow, since the moment he finishes taking pictures till he delivers it to his clients. 

It is my first professional experience as a developer. Since the first day I started working there, I felt in love for real with solving problems using programming, because I discovered the pleasure of being able to impact lots of people while doing something I loved.

Even as a simple Intern, I was able to help them while learning from aws cloud architecture to software development in general, so I got in touch a lot with `AWS EC2, AWS S3, AWS SQS, AWS ElastiCache, AWS Lambda, AWS RDS, AWS CloudFront, GC Compute Engine, Redis, React, Redux, NodeJS, Styled Components, Serverless and MVC Architecture`.

Besides, I had great realizations there, like, `refactored its landing page, created a distributed information system based on Redis, solved a bug that was making them lose clients everyday, found and helped solving an architecture bug that kept all the platform offline for almost 4 entire days, created the event oriented microservices system, created a background processing application to work on side jobs such as mail sending and pictures processing, made a custom react hook for data validation/sanitization with help of back-end to improve user feedback and headed a project to refactor all the platform back-end/front-end from their client to their api and background processing app while keeping in touch with senior developers`.

**[ 2019/02 - 2019/10 ]** [IBESVA](https://ibesva.netlify.com) ``(Web Front-end Developer)``

That's a Non-governmental organization that helps the education cause.

It was my first volunteering experience as a software developer. For the first time I was able to help people solving problems with programming, what made me fell in love with technology a little more and helped me getting into the professional road of Software Development. As a volunteer, I refactored the IBESVA's Website Design using/improving all knowledge I had when it was about `HTML5, CSS3, jQuery and Adobe XD`.
